# whats-new-dotnet-5

Note: Module 02 is the first module in the course after the intro video, which is technically module 1. 
Because Module 02 is mostly setup and intro content, there is no start/end branch for this - only start.

The rest of the modules all have branches for the start and end state of the project for that module.

Thank you for checking out this course and repo!
